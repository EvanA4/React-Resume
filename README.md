# React-Resume
A not-very-lightweight website demonstrating my creativity, experience, and projects.

## How does it work?
It uses a whole lot of media queries, but it also uses libraries like `react-three-fiber` and `react-three-rapier`. These are responsible for the general 3D rendering and physics engine, respectively.

The 2D animation and 3D model were made in Blender.

See it live at `evanabbott.net`!

### TODO
1. Slowly add miniEvans instead of adding them all at once.
2. Start out with physics simulation off?
- add start and end button to toggle
3. Automatically end simulation when off screen?
