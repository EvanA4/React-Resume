# React-Resume
A not-very-lightweight website demonstrating my creativity, experience, and projects.

## How does it work?
It uses a whole lot of media queries, but it also uses libraries like `react-three-fiber` and `react-three-rapier`. These are responsible for the general 3D rendering and physics engine, respectively.

The 2D animation and 3D model were made in Blender.
